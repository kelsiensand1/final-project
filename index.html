          The coronavirus has shed light on how healthcare workers have treated
          patients despite the risks of getting infected. Daily cheers, news
          coverage and community efforts have all praised how healthcare workers
          have risen to the challenge in saving patients during the coronavirus
          pandemic. Yet, home health aides rarely get lauded, even though they
          continue to go to work every day and risk infecting themselves, their
          clients and their family members.
          <span class="midterm">2018 midterms</span>.

        <p class="g-copy">
          Not only are home health aides continuing to go to work, they are not
          getting support from their employers. In addition to these dangerous
          conditions, home health aides make on average $26,240 a year.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “You think since we’re in healthcare, they’d provide us with ppe,”
          said Kawehkadawije Dailey. A home health aide in Newark, New York,
          Dailey feels frustrated that her employer, the Center for Disability
          Rights, has not provided face masks or gloves. But she’s still
          continuing to go to work because she loves her clients.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Public home health agencies are funded through Medicaid. And while
          other states have paid home health aides an extra $2 an hour through
          hazard pay, New York has not designated any hazard pay to home health
          aides.

          Home health aides have a history of being neglected, according to
          Allison Cook who is policy mangers at PHI, a nonprofit dedicated to
          doing research on behalf of direct care workers. “If anything, this is
          highlighting the existing challenges within the healthcare system,”
          she said.

          Heather Chadwich is another home health aid continuing to go work. She
          is taking extra precautions because her husband is going through
          cancer treatment and is another individual vulnerable to the disease.
          “I’m still going to work because I love the family,” she said.
